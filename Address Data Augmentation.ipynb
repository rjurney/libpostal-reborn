    "### Human in the Loop Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "We may have enough diversity of examples to generate sufficient training data to cover most addresses (at least North American ones). To improve performance, we can create new hand-labeled examples that fix the errors in `match_df` and `mismatch_df` and re-run the data augmentation pipeline to then re-train and evaluate our matching models. **This gives product managers of AI products a means of product managing their models' predictions.**\n",

    "\n",
    "Hand labeling is a slow way to create labeled datasets. We need a lot more data than we have, and I can't spare the time to label thousands of records. We could use \"mechanical turks\" to do this work, but instead we're going to use a data augmentation strategy to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create semantically similar duplicates for each of our original 29 labeled pairs. The address pair descriptions, along with the match/mis-match label, will guide the LLM in creating semantically similar labeled address pairs. \n",

    "### OpenAI GPT4o for Data Augmentation\n",

    "\n",
    "We set the temporature of the LLM high to ensure we get a diverse set of records. 100 records is as many as we can request at once, so we're going to loop 5 times to get approximately 10,000 labeled address pairs.\n",

I have created 76 example pairs of addresses to serve as gold label training data for fine-tuning a SentenceTransformer model. Each record has the fields Address1, Address2, a Description of the semantic the pair of addresses express (ex. 'different street number means different address') and a Label (1 for positive match, 0 for negative).\n",
